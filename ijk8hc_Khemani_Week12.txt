1. I have enjoyed doing work that has truly helped me professionally, rather than doing assignments that are less applicable in the real world the way I do in other classes. The instructors have all been very kind and helpful, and I really feel like the things I have been exposed to in this class will be applicable further in my career.
2. I would change the course to have more options for activities. This way if a student was particularly interested in a specific area, they could keep focusing on that area. Or, if a student already knew about a specific area, they would not have to do an assignment that would not further their knowledge.
3. Do all the activities even if they confuse you! It will be beneficial even if you think you are doing it wrong.
